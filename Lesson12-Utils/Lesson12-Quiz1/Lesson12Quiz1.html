<h2>Question 1:</h2>
<p>
Look through the jQuery utilities in the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/utilities/" target="_blank">documentation</a> and find a utility function that removes leading and trailing white space from strings.</p>

<h3>Answer 1:</h3>

<p><a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/" target="_blank">http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim</a>/</p>

<h2>Question 2:</h2>

<p>Look at the code below:</p>

<pre>var a1 = [1, 3, 5];
var a2 = [2, 4, 6];
$.merge(a1, a2); 
alert(a1);</pre>

<p>What is displayed in the alert? Why? </p>

<h3>Answer 2:</h3>

<p>An alert box with the following text: <br>
1,3,5,2,4,6
</p>
<p>the .merge method takes the second array and merges it with the first, maintaining the order of the elements.
</p>

                                                                                                 
<h2>Question 3</h2>
<p>Describe the difference between a jQuery method, like addClass(), and a jQuery utility function, like $.trim().</p>

<h3>Answer 3:</h3>

<ul>
<li>jQuery methods, like addClass(), are functions bound to various html elements in the DOM, usually implemented with a statement like: <br> $("div#hello").addClass('myClass'); </li>
<li>jQuery utilities, on the other hand, like $.trim(), provide you the ability to accomplish routine tasks such as removing whitespace, merging arrays or finding the current time. These utilities operate within the $ namespace rather than being bound to specific DOM elements. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Question 4:</h2>
<p>What is a benefit of using the jQuery library? Will you be using it in your web application projects from now on?</p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to easily select elements in the DOM</li>
<li>Large collection of functions/methods</li>
<li>Ability to use the .each function that provides manipulation or operations on large collections of DOM elements iteratively</li>

</ul>
<p>I will definitely be using jQuery in the future.</p>
