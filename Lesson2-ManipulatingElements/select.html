      <h3>Excerpt from <em>Scandal in Bohemia</em></h3>
      <h4>by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a></h4>
      <p class="first">
        It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom,
        ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes,
        walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in
        the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that
        it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged
        in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands
        into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed
        heartily for some minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, <em>really</em>!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he
        was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What is it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed
        my morning, or what I ended by doing."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits,
        and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."
