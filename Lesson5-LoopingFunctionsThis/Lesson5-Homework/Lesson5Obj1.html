Save it in your /jQuery folder as hotdog1.html, and add a complete jQuery program that changes the background-color CSS property of the odd numbered rows of the table to be "lightgrey." You are not allowed to use the ":odd" filter!

Hint: You can use the "mod" math function % to help determine if a row is odd or even if you need to.
